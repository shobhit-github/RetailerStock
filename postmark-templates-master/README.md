# Postmark Transactional Email Templates
Content ready, mobile friendly, and beautiful across all major email clients.

#### What's this for?

*Postmark Transactional Email Templates* are rock-solid email templates that render beautifully in tons of email clients. They provide the foundation of our [Postmark Templates](http://blog.postmarkapp.com/post/125849089273/special-delivery-postmark-templates) feature, and we're glad to provide them as Open Source to the wider community.

These templates are built and maintained using [MailMason](https://github.com/wildbit/mailmason), a grunt-based framework to help streamline the process of developing, testing, and maintaining a set of related transactional email templates. If you want to create or customize your own set of email templates, you can use MailMason to extend the existing emails or start from scratch to build an entirely new set.

## CSS & Inlining

There are two sets of templates here. The first set is in the `/templates` folder and contains the base templates with the CSS all contained in a style block. In this state, they're easier to edit, but they'll have limited compatibility with email clients. The other set in `/templates_inlined` has the same templates but with the CSS already inlined. They'll be a bit more tedious to make changes to, but you won't need to use anything to inline the CSS.

### Inline the CSS
For client compatibility, HTML emails should always be inlined before sending. Here are a couple of tools for doing that:

* [Postmark Style Merge](https://github.com/wildbit/style-merge)
* [Premailer](https://github.com/peterbe/premailer)

If you choose to send your emails with [Postmark](http://postmarkapp.com), each time you send we will automagically inline the CSS for you.

### Comment notification

Notify users of new comments by other users.

**Note:** Comment notification isn't the prettiest preview because it's just Mustachio. Since almost all content in these emails is dynamic, they don't look good without real content. So don't worry though, that's how they're supposed to look.
